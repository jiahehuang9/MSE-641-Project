This is the improved version of the baseline model with dimensionality reduction, text clustering, results analysis, and visualization. SVD and UMAP are applied for dimensionality reduction. K-Means is used for initial clustering, followed by outliers detection by DBSCAN. Silhouette Score, Calinski-Harabasz Index, and Davies-Bouldin Index are three evaluation metrics. Clustering result examples are shown. Simply download the package required and load the dataset to run the code step by step.
